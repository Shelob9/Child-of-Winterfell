Child-of-Winterfell
===================

Child themes for the Winterfell WordPress theme. https://github.com/Shelob9/winterfell

What Is Included
================
style.css, javascripts/custom.js and not much else.
Custom.js controls masonry. The included version is identical to the version in the theme. When a child theme is used the theme will look for custom.js in the child theme. This way you can change your settings in the child theme, not the parent.
